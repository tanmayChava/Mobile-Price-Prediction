# 📱 Mobile Price Prediction
A machine learning project to predict the price range of mobile phones based on their specifications.

📌 Overview
This project uses a dataset containing features of various mobile phones (e.g., RAM, battery power, screen size) to predict their price category. The model is trained using supervised learning techniques and aims to help manufacturers or retailers estimate competitive pricing for new devices.

🚀 Project Objectives
Preprocess textual and numerical features (e.g., convert "128 GB" to integer, extract megapixels).
Train a regression model to predict price in USD. 
Visualize key trends and feature importance.

🧠 Machine Learning Approach
